# LTT Client
This was my 2022 AprilFools joke.
<br>
<br>
Quite a number of people on the Discord / YouTube comments wanted this to be released, so I have put it up on GitHub. Please see the building instructions below.
<br>
<br>
 _**If you are not familier with MCP, creating Minecraft Clients, or Git: DO NOT attempt to build this! You will get very frustrated very quickly. There will be NO SUPPORT for building this client.**_
 <br>
 <br>
  There are lots of bugs, weird quirks, and undocumented code. This was slapped together in a few days because I procrastinated April Fools again. I know I need to stop doing this. Maybe ill actually get a better client done for 2023.

## Building
1) Download a fresh MCP 940 (Minecraft 1.12)
2) Replace the `conf` folder in your MCP project with the one from this repo.
3) Decopile MCP
3) Copy `jars`, `lib`, `src` from this repo into your MCP ROOT folder.
4) Apply the [patch file](patches/net.minecraft.patch) in this repo to the `net.minecraft` files.
5) Refresh your project to make sure your IDE is happy
6) Buy some LTT merch\*

## Bugs & Quirks
 - The launch screen was faked. Chroma Key FTW.

 - You need to enable the `Fuck you Optifine` resource pack. The name should state why you need it enabled.

 - Shitty code that isn't well documented

## Final Notes
  Please don't use this code just to skid. I released this to show how I pulled off some of the tricks seen in the video.
